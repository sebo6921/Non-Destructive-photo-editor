## ANDIE - A Non-Destructive Image Editor
ANDIE is an image processing and editing program, a bit like Photoshop. As ANDIE is a non-destructive image editor, many image processing operations, such as blurring filters, cannot be reversed because information is lost in the process. ANDIE stores the original image and a sequence of the operations, these operations can then be applied to a copy of the original image to get the desired result. Since the original image and the full sequence of operations is kept, no information is lost.

# How ANDIE Was Tested
ANDIE was tested through by running the program through different devices and operating systems. ANDIE was tested throughout the building process of each feature, it was also run to test usability and any problems or issues that users may face as a result of using the program.
